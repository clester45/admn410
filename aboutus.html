		<h3><font color="blue"> Our store first opened in 1997. Back then, we were only able to care for dogs. With only the capacity to sell the necessities for dogs, we sold minimal products pretaining to them. Over the years we were able to grow in popularity enough to move to a bigger store meaning that we could have the potential to care for more animals. In 2005, we started to do more than just sell prdoucts for your pets. We began to offer daycare, vaccinations, and cleaning so that we can better serve you and your pets. Over the years we also began to grow and open more stores on the East Coast and established our corporate office in Durham, where it all began. Although we have branched out and expanded, each day we strive to offer you the best help and care that we can so you and your pet can live your best life.</font color></h3>
		<h1><center> Why Us?</center> </h1>
		<h3><font color="blue"> We are a family owned store whose number one priority is giving your pets the best care possible and not revenue. We try our best each day to find better and more efficient ways to serve our customers. Because here, we don't see our customers and just another person, we try to create lasting relationships with our customers so that you feel at home when you come to us.</h3>
